# Stock-Price-Prediction-Sentiment-Analysis

Stock market prediction has been an active area of research for a long
time. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that stock market
prices are largely driven by new information and follow a random walk
pattern. Though this hypothesis is widely accepted by the research
community as a central paradigm governing the markets in general,
several people have attempted to extract patterns in the way stock
markets behave and respond to external stimuli. In this project, we test
a hypothesis based on the premise of behavioral economics, that the
emotions and moods of individuals affect their decision-making process,
thus, leading to a direct correlation between "public sentiment" and
"market sentiment". We perform sentiment analysis on publicly available
Twitter data to find the public mood and the degree of membership into 3
classes - positive, negative or neutral The App forecasts stock prices
of the next seven days for any given stock under NASDAQ or NSE as input
by the user.
